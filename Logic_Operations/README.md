## Logic AND, OR, XOR operations implemented through Perceptron

A 1024 random bernulli distributed binary sequence is generated. Then on 2-by-2 bits, it is calculated the output of AND, OR, XOR logic gates respectively(so 512 outputs produced).

Then, a message is printed informing for the mean-square-error of each logic operation implemented on perceptron training.
